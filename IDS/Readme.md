# 🚨 Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) implemented using a Jupyter Notebook. It classifies network activity as either normal or an intrusion attempt, based on a labeled dataset.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- To detect suspicious or malicious network activity using supervised ML techniques.
- To evaluate different models for accuracy and effectiveness in real-time intrusion detection.

---

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📂 Files Included

- `Intrusion_Detection.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all code, from preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This project documentation.

## 🧠 Steps to Reproduce the Project

### 1. 📥 Import Required Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score

3. ✂️ Split Data

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

4. 🧠 Train ML Model

model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

5. 📊 Evaluate Model

predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))

📈 Sample Output Metrics
Accuracy: ~95%

Confusion Matrix and Precision/Recall for different intrusion types

Future Enhancements
Implement deep learning (e.g., LSTM, autoencoders)

Use real-time streaming data (e.g., from packet sniffers)

Integrate with alerting systems (email, dashboard)
